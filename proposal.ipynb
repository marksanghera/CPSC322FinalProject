    "The dataset is sourced from the **Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) Small-Body Database**, maintained by the California Institute of Technology under NASA. It is publicly available on the JPL Small-Body Database Search Engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Format\n",
    "The dataset is provided in a csv, containing various columns related to asteroid characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Contents\n",
    "The dataset includes detailed information about asteroids, such as their physical and orbital properties. Below is a brief description of the key attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Attributes\n",
    "- **SPK-ID**: Object primary SPK-ID (unique identifier for the asteroid).\n",
    "- **Object ID**: Internal database ID for the object.\n",
    "- **Object Fullname**: Full name or designation of the asteroid.\n",
    "- **pdes**: Primary designation of the asteroid.\n",
    "- **name**: International Astronomical Union (IAU) name of the asteroid.\n",
    "- **NEO**: Near-Earth Object flag, indicating if the object is a Near-Earth Object (1) or not (0).\n",
    "- **PHA**: Potentially Hazardous Asteroid flag, indicating if the asteroid poses a threat (1) or not (0).\n",
    "- **H**: Absolute magnitude parameter.\n",
    "- **Diameter**: Estimated diameter of the asteroid in kilometers.\n",
    "- **Albedo**: Geometric albedo (reflectivity) of the asteroid.\n",
    "- **Diameter_sigma**: 1-sigma uncertainty in the diameter measurement (km).\n",
    "- **Orbit_id**: Orbit solution ID.\n",
    "- **Epoch**: Epoch of osculation in modified Julian day form.\n",
    "- **Equinox**: Reference frame equinox.\n",
    "- **e**: Orbital eccentricity.\n",
    "- **a**: Semi-major axis (in astronomical units).\n",
